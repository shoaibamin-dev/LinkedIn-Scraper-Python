More than 400,000 students have been successfully trained. Arena classrooms are equipped with world-class infrastructure such as state-of-the-art technology, practice labs, high-end animation tools, 2D animation facilities, 3D software and art rooms.

My Mood Diary:
Software for monitoring health condition of psychiatric patients.

From the short lived misery of being stuck in traffic to the post divorce suicidal depression, the general state of the mind directly affects people's overall health of their minds. This application gives a person a tool to record an accurate time history of these moods which is vital to understanding the mind. A person can look back at these variations in mood at a later stage to discover and improve what makes them tick. Most importantly doctors solely depend on a patient's history for diagnosis of a disorder. They can use this tool to see the underlying patterns in moods and behaviour to see and stop a total nervous breakdown while it is in its infancy.

Technologies:
Java, Containers, key features of Android such as Layouts, Input Controls, Input Events, Notifications, Toasts, Activities, Intents, CSV sheets, emails, images/videos/audios/notes etc, third party libraries such as GraphView, AChartEngine, AndroidPlot, opencsv-2.4 etc.

• Allows to record the intensity of factors on a scale of 1-10 that contribute to one's mood.
• Highlight the scales with different colors at different times and dates where each color represents the intensity of a factor - 10 (green) being the BEST, 5 (yellow) being the AVERAGE and 1 (red) being the WORST
• Allows to see the summary (in the form of a table) of a specific day's mood.
• Allows to see mood data on a graph - for a specific factor(s), specific date(s) and specific time.
• Allows to record and view Videos (Play List), Photos (Gallery), Audios (Play List), CVS, Notes.
• Allows to set an Alarm.
